# Eyes Emoji (3D)

## Intro
For the course "Flex" I introduce students in about 6 weeks to CSS-Art, making works of art in CSS. One of these works of art is the one you see above. The eyes/eyes emoji recreated in HTML and CSS. No SVGs or images! Made with the BEM standard. In addition, a support query has also been added. 

## Things I've Learned
1. A gradient (possibly with an angle) can give a cool 3D effect, especially when you place an object (such as an iris) on it.
2. A "sham effect" (the white on the iris) gives an even stronger 3D effect in combination with 1.
3. Re-learned the difference between spread and blur on a box-shadow. A blur is (usually) applied at the end and a spread indicates the size of the shadow (how far the shadow extends).
4. Learned how to use emoticons with UTF-8 in HTML.
5. About the first version made in +- 30 minutes. I'm getting faster and faster and was amazed that I could realize this so quickly!

## Screenshots
